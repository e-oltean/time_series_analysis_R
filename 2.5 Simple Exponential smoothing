#If you have a time series that can be described using an additive model 
#with constant level and no seasonality, you can use simple exponential 
#smoothing to make short-term forecasts.
#The simple exponential smoothing method provides a way of estimating 
#the level at the current time point. Smoothing is controlled by the 
#parameter alpha; for the estimate of the level at the current time point. 
#The value of alpha; lies between 0 and 1. Values of alpha that are close to 0 mean that little weight is placed on the most recent observations when making forecasts of future values.

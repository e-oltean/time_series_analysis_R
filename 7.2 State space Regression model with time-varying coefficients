#The time series regression models so far were about a 
#process is stationary and hence that the coefficients are constant.
#even if the predictor variables do not explicitly 
#include time, and state space models are ideally 
#suited to relaxing the restriction.
#We fit a straight line with time-varying coefficient.

#The components of θt are the intercept and slope at time t, 
#and the estimates from the Kalman filter. In this application, 
#the matrix F , Fmat in the SS function, is time varying and is (1, xt )′ .
#The matrix Gmat is the identity matrix, which we use diag to generate. 
#The parameter variation, which is modelled with matrix Wmat, is small
#relative to the observation variance modelled by Vmat.

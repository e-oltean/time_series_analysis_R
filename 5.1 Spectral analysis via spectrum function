#A plot of  spikes, against m is a Fourier line spectrum. 
#The raw periodogram in R is obtained by joining the tips 
#of the spikes in the Fourier line spectrum to give a 
#continuous plot and scaling it so that the area equals
#the variance. The periodogram distributes the variance 
#over frequency

#next step is to select the appropriate ARIMA model, 
#which means finding the values of most appropriate values of p
#and q for an ARIMA(p,d,q) model.

#data creation
kings <- scan("http://robjhyndman.com/tsdldata/misc/kings.dat",skip=3)
kingstimeseries <- ts(kings)

# create stationarity through differentiation
kingtimeseriesdiff1 <- diff(kingstimeseries, differences=1)
plot.ts(kingtimeseriesdiff1)

#calculate autocorrelation function
acf(kingtimeseriesdiff1, lag.max=20) # plot a correlogram
acf(kingtimeseriesdiff1, lag.max=20, plot=FALSE) # get the autocorrelation values

#calculate partial autocorrelation function
pacf(kingtimeseriesdiff1, lag.max=20) # plot a correlogram
pacf(kingtimeseriesdiff1, lag.max=20, plot=FALSE) # get the autocorrelation values

#Since the correlogram is zero after lag 1, and the partial correlogram tails off 
#to zero after lag 3, this means that an ARMA(3,0) model, that is, an 
#autoregressive model of order p=3 or an ARMA(0,1) model, that is, 
#a moving average model of order q=1

#We use the principle of parsimony to decide which model is best: that is, 
#we assume that the model with the fewest parameters is best. 
#The ARMA(3,0) model has 3 parameters, the ARMA(0,1) model has 1 parameter, and
#the ARMA(p,q) model has at least 2 parameters. Therefore, the ARMA(0,1) model 
#is taken as the best model.

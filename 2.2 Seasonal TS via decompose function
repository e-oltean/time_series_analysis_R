#A seasonal time series consists of a trend component, a seasonal component
#and an irregular component. Decomposing the time series means separating the 
#time series into these three components: that is, estimating these three components.

#To estimate the trend component and seasonal component of a seasonal time series that 
#can be described using an additive model, we can use the “decompose()” function in R. 
#This function estimates the trend, seasonal, and irregular components of a time series 
#that can be described using an additive model.
#The function “decompose()” returns a list object as its result, where the estimates of 
#the seasonal component, trend component and irregular component are stored in named elements 
#of that list objects, called “seasonal”, “trend”, and “random” respectively.

#create the data
births <- scan("http://robjhyndman.com/tsdldata/data/nybirths.dat")
birthstimeseries <- ts(births, frequency=12, start=c(1946,1))

#decompose the time series into seasonal effect and trend
birthstimeseriescomponents <- decompose(birthstimeseries)
seasonal=birthstimeseriescomponents$seasonal
trend=birthstimeseriescomponents$trend
ts.plot(cbind(trend, trend * seasonal), lty = 1:2)
plot(birthstimeseriescomponents)

# this is more suitable for a multiplicative model of a time series

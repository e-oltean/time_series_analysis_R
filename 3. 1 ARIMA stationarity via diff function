#If you have to difference the time series d times to obtain a stationary 
#series, then you have an ARIMA(p,d,q) model, where d is the order of 
#differencing used.

#greate data
skirts <- scan("http://robjhyndman.com/tsdldata/roberts/skirts.dat",skip=5)
skirtsseries <- ts(skirts,start=c(1866))
plot.ts(skirtsseries)

# create stationarity through differentiation
skirtsseriesdiff1 <- diff(skirtsseries, differences=1)
plot.ts(skirtsseriesdiff1)

#The resulting time series of first differences (above)
#does not appear to be stationary in mean. Therefore, we can
#difference the time series twice, to see if that gives us a 
#stationary time series:
skirtsseriesdiff2 <- diff(skirtsseries, differences=2)
plot.ts(skirtsseriesdiff2)

#If you need to difference your original time series data d times 
#in order to obtain a stationary time series, this means
#that you can use an ARIMA(p,d,q) model for your time series, 
#where d is the order of differencing used.

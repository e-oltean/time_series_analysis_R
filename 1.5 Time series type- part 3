#Decomposing a time series means separating it into its constituent components, 
#which are usually a trend component and an irregular component, and if it is a 
#seasonal time series, a seasonal component.

souvenir <- scan("http://robjhyndman.com/tsdldata/data/fancy.dat")
souvenirtimeseries <- ts(souvenir, frequency=12, start=c(1987,1))
plot.ts(souvenirtimeseries)

#In this case, it appears that an additive model is not appropriate for describing
#this time series, since the size of the seasonal fluctuations and random fluctuations
#seem to increase with the level of the time series. Thus, we may need to transform 
#the time series in order to get a transformed time series that can be described using
#an additive model. For example, we can transform the time series by calculating the 
#natural log of the original data:

logsouvenirtimeseries <- log(souvenirtimeseries)
plot.ts(logsouvenirtimeseries)

#Here we can see that the size of the seasonal fluctuations and random fluctuations in 
#the log-transformed time series seem to be roughly constant over time, and do not depend
#on the level of the time series. Thus, the log-transformed time series can probably be 
#described using an additive model.

#Estimate Spectral Density of a Time Series by a Smoothed Periodogram
#spec.pgramÂ calculates the periodogram using a fast Fourier transform, 
#and optionally smooths the result with a series of modified Daniell
#smoothers (moving averages giving half weight to the end values).

#If no span is specified in the spectrum function,  the heights 
#of the Fourier line spectrum spikes to construct a spectrum with no smoothing.

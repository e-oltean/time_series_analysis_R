# Holt-Winters exponential
#smoothing estimates the level, slope and seasonal component at the current 
#time point. Smoothing is controlled by three parameters: alpha, beta, and gamma,
#for the estimates of the level, slope b of the trend component, and the seasonal 
#component, respectively, at the current time point. The parameters alpha, beta and 
#gamma all have values between 0 and 1, and values that are close to 0 mean that 
#relatively little weight is placed on the most recent observations when making 
#forecasts of future values.

#data creation
souvenir <- scan("http://robjhyndman.com/tsdldata/data/fancy.dat")
souvenirtimeseries <- ts(souvenir, frequency=12, start=c(1987,1))
plot.ts(souvenirtimeseries)
logsouvenirtimeseries <- log(souvenirtimeseries)

#use Holt Winter exponential smoothing
souvenirtimeseriesforecasts <- HoltWinters(logsouvenirtimeseries)

#The estimated values of alpha, beta and gamma are 0.41, 0.00, and 0.96,
#respectively. The value of alpha (0.41) is relatively low, indicating that
#the estimate of the level at the current time point is based upon both recent
#observations and some observations in the more distant past. The value of beta
#is 0.00, indicating that the estimate of the slope b of the trend component 
#is not updated over the time series, and instead is set equal to its initial 
#value. This makes good intuitive sense, as the level changes quite a bit over
#the time series, but the slope b of the trend component remains roughly the
#same. In contrast, the value of gamma (0.96) is high, indicating that the 
#estimate of the seasonal component at the current time point is just based 
#upon very recent observations.

#forecast
souvenirtimeseriesforecasts2 <- forecast.HoltWinters(souvenirtimeseriesforecasts,
                                                     ˓→h=48)
plot.forecast(souvenirtimeseriesforecasts2)

#checking whether the in-sample forecast
#errors show non-zero autocorrelations at lags 1-20,
#by making a correlogram and carrying out the Ljung-Box test:
acf(souvenirtimeseriesforecasts2$residuals, lag.max=20)
Box.test(souvenirtimeseriesforecasts2$residuals, lag=20, type="Ljung-Box")

> plot.ts(souvenirtimeseriesforecasts2$residuals)
# make a time plot
plotForecastErrors(souvenirtimeseriesforecasts2$residuals) # make a histogram

#From the time plot, it appears plausible that the forecast errors have constant
#variance over time. From the histogram of forecast errors, it seems plausible
#that the forecast errors are normally distributed with mean zero.

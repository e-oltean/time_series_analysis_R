#Decomposing a time series means separating it into its constituent components, 
#which are usually a trend component and an irregular component, and if it is a 
#seasonal time series, a seasonal component.

births <- scan("http://robjhyndman.com/tsdldata/data/nybirths.dat")

#We can see from this time series that there seems to be seasonal variation in the
#number of births per month: there is a peak every summer, and a trough every winter.
#Again, it seems that this time series could probably be described using an additive 
#model, as the seasonal fluctuations are roughly constant in size over time and do not 
#seem to depend on the level of the time series, and the random fluctuations also seem 
#to be roughly constant in size over time.

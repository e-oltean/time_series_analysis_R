#If a series exhibits periods of increased variance, so the variance is correlated
#in time (as observed in the S&P500 data), the series exhibits volatility and is
#called conditional heteroskedastic.

#the form is x(t)=α(mean)+α(i)e(t-i)+b(j)x(t-j), where alpha is the coefficient of MA 
#and beta is the coefficient of thne conditional variance (x)

#From this we can see that there is evidence of serial correlation in the squared
#values, so there is evidence of conditional heteroskedastic behaviour and volatility

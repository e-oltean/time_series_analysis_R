#we check time series models that contain unit roots are suitable.
#if so, we need to decide whether or not there is a common stochastic trend. 
#by looking at the correlogram of the differenced series 
#Whilst this may work for a simple random walk, we have seen in
#for  more complex ARIMA processes.

#Phillips-Perron test via function pp.test.  Phillips-Perron procedure 
#estimates the autocorrelations in the stationary process ut directly
#(using a kernel smoother) rather than assuming an AR approximation,
#and for this reason the Phillips-Perron test is described as semi-parametric.

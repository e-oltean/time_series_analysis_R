#Holtâ€™s exponential 
#smoothing estimates the level and slope at the current time point. Smoothing
#is controlled by two parameters, alpha, for the estimate of the level at the 
#current time point, and beta for the estimate of the slope b of the trend 
#component at the current time point. As with simple exponential smoothing, 
#the paramters alpha and beta have values between 0 and 1, and values that 
#are close to 0 mean that little weight is placed on the most recent 
#observations when making forecasts of future values.

#data creation
skirts <- scan("http://robjhyndman.com/tsdldata/roberts/skirts.dat",skip=5)

#use Hotlt's exponential smooth
skirtsseriesforecasts <- HoltWinters(skirtsseries, gamma=FALSE)

#The estimated value of alpha is 0.84, and of beta is 1.00. These are both high,
#telling us that both the estimate of the current value of the level, and of the 
#slope b of the trend component, are based mostly upon very recent observations
#in the time series. This makes good intuitive sense, since the level and the slope
#of the time series both change quite a lot over time. The value of the sum-of-squared
#-errors for the in-sample forecast errors is 16954.

#A non-seasonal time series consists of a trend component and an irregular 
#component. Decomposing the time series involves trying to separate the 
#time series into these components, that is, estimating the the trend 
#component and the irregular component.

#The SMA() function in the “TTR” R package can be used to smooth time
#series data using a simple moving average.

#this is a short term prediction method

#download and turn it into a TS
kings <- scan("http://robjhyndman.com/tsdldata/misc/kings.dat",skip=3)
kingstimeseries <- ts(kings)

#install TTR package
install.packages("TTR")
library("TTR")
kingstimeseriesSMA3 <- SMA(kingstimeseries,n=3)
plot.ts(kingstimeseriesSMA3)

#There still appears to be quite a lot of random fluctuations in the time
#series smoothed using a simple moving average of order 3. Thus, to estimate
#the trend component more accurately, we might want to try smoothing the
#data with a simple moving average of a higher order. This takes a little 
#bit of trial-and-error, to find the right amount of smoothing. For example, 
#we can try using a simple moving average of order 8:

kingstimeseriesSMA8 <- SMA(kingstimeseries,n=8)
plot.ts(kingstimeseriesSMA8)

#The data smoothed with a simple moving average of order 8 gives a clearer
#picture of the trend component, and we can see that the age of death of 
#the English kings seems to have decreased from about 55 years old to about
#38 years old during the reign of the first 20 kings, and then increased after
#that to about 73 years old by the end of the reign of the 40th king in the time series.

#Once you have selected the best candidate ARIMA(p,d,q) model for your 
#time series data, you can estimate the parameters of that ARIMA model, 
#and use that as a predictive model for making forecasts for future 
#values of your time series. 

#data creation
kings <- scan("http://robjhyndman.com/tsdldata/misc/kings.dat",skip=3)
kingstimeseries <- ts(kings)

#fitting the data with arima model 
kingstimeseriesarima <- arima(kingstimeseries, order=c(0,1,1)) # fit an ARIMA(0,1,1) model
#As mentioned above, if we are fitting an ARIMA(0,1,1) model to our time series, it means 
#we are fitting an an ARMA(0,1) model to the time series of first differences.

#forecast 
install.packages("forecast")
library("forecast") # load the "forecast" R library
kingstimeseriesforecasts <- forecast.Arima(kingstimeseriesarima, h=5)
plot.forecast(kingstimeseriesforecasts)

#investigate whether the forecast errors of an ARIMA model are 
#normally distributed with mean zero and constant variance, and 
#whether the are correlations between successive forecast errors.
acf(kingstimeseriesforecasts$residuals, lag.max=20)
Box.test(kingstimeseriesforecasts$residuals, lag=20, type="Ljung-Box")

#Since the correlogram shows that none of the sample autocorrelations 
#for lags 1-20 exceed the significance bounds, and the p-value for the
#Ljung-Box test is 0.9, we can conclude that there is very little evidence 
#for non-zero autocorrelations in the forecast errors at lags 1-20.

#To investigate whether the forecast errors are normally distributed with 
#mean zero and constant variance, we can make a time plot and histogram 
#(with overlaid normal curve) of the forecast errors:

plot.ts(kingstimeseriesforecasts$residuals)
# make time plot of forecast errors
plotForecastErrors(kingstimeseriesforecasts$residuals) # make a histogram

#Since successive forecast errors do not seem to be correlated, and the 
#forecast errors seem to be normally distributed with mean zero and constant variance, 
#the ARIMA(0,1,1) does seem to provide an adequate predictive model.
